## up
a php script to upload files, but with an account that lets u manage files

### php????
YEAH. just wanted to test it, apparently php 7 is better

### stuff
i have no idea what i'm doing because i havent touched php in years

need to figure out:
- how are php projects organized in $current_year?
- how to store user/passwords. i dont want to install mysql
- nice routes? like `/home` instead of `/index.php`
