## up
a php script to upload files

- account to manage files
- invite-only system


### how to use
copy the repo and configure your server to serve the `public` folder

then go to `/setup.php` to create the first user.

### php????
YEAH. just wanted to test it, apparently php 7 is better

### notes
**i have no idea what i'm doing** because i havent touched php in years

need to figure out:
- nice routes? like `/home` instead of `/index.php`

figured out:
- how are php projects organized in $current_year? \
  apparently someone figured it out https://github.com/php-pds/skeleton
- how to store user/passwords. i dont want to install mysql \
  went with sqlite3
